            <h5><b>1. Formats for IJMMU Journal Contributions</b></h5>
            <h6>The manuscripts must be submitted online or via email as an attached file to the relevant email address of the IJMMU.</h6>
            <br>
            <h5><b>1.1 Research Articles</b></h5>
            <h6>Research papers are original and inventive reports based on authentic evidence which further the comprehension of a problem in their relevant field, and have straight and extensive implications. <br>
                An average research article may range from 2000-20000 words (this includes the bibliography, and citations, and captions, and may amount to approximately 25 pages in total), and is for the cause of presenting a substantial progress. <br>
                The format for a research article includes an abstract, an introduction, tables and figures, dividing sections with descriptive and concise subheadings.There is a need for the provision of materials and methods, to add authenticity to the paper’s conclusion.</h6>
            <br>
            <h5><b>1.2 Letters</b></h5>
            <h6>Letters may be described as concise findings obtained via creative research, whose relevance and significance lies in the fact that they may interest researchers pertaining to different fields. A letter should have no more than 25 references. <br>

                It starts off with a brief, usually 200 word paragraph addressing researchers and readers from other fields. The introduction may not exceed 300 words and should be condensed and concise. They are approximately 2500 words long, including bibliography, citations, notes, and captions and amount to ~3 pages. The format followed by a letter includes an abstract, an introductory passage, and up to 4 tables or figures. There is a need for the provision of materials and methods, to add authenticity to the paper’s conclusion.</h6>
            <br>
            <h5><b>1.3 Reviews</b></h5>
            <h6>The purpose of reviews is to elucidate the significance of and advancement in interdisciplinary terms and discover new directions that may be taken. They are usually approximately 3500 words long, including bibliography, citations, notes, and captions. The format followed by a review includes an abstract, a concise introduction relating to the theme of the content reviewed, concise subheadings, and a general description of unresolved questions pertaining to the content. The references may not exceed 50 materials. Reviews are usually sought by the editors; however, unsought review submissions may also be accepted.</h6>
            <br>
            <h5><b>2. Manuscript Selection</b></h5>
            <h6>The language adopted by the manuscripts should be clear and comprehensible, so as there is no difficulty for readers from other disciplines and non-native English readers in discerning it. The final decision id communicated to the author via phone or email. Sending multiple submissions of one manuscript will only result in acknowledgment of one. All submissions sent to the IJMMU are considered as confidential documents. The process of peer reviewing is also private with no disclosure of the identity of the reviewers or their details. For selected submissions, there are two external referees chosen for an extensive in-depth evaluation of the manuscript. The process of reviewing a paper may take anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks and reviewers are contacted before being sent the submission that needs to be reviewed. Papers in need of a quick and thorough assessment have a shorter but equally efficient reviewing process. The finalized submissions undergo an extensive editing process to review and ensure length, clarity, and conciseness. In case of conflict arising from subjective causes such as interest and comparative merit, the papers may not be resubmitted. There may be consideration about resubmission if the rejection of a paper was due to a reviewing mistake. It may be that the reviewing board finds that the format of the paper, its objectives and conclusions clear and well-derived, but the subject may not be of interest to the IJMMU due to which it may not be accepted. In some cases, there will be another opportunity of publication provided to the author, on condition that there will be further reviewing and the supplementary data and experimentation required by the reviewer is to be presented by the author. On some occasions, a submission of an adequate word count may be accepted without further reviewing. <br>

                There is an effort to finalize the decisions regarding the submissions as quickly as possible. During the consideration procedure, the manuscripts are dealt with electronically. The notification period regarding a submission is usually one week.</h6>
            <br>
            <h5><b>3. Format of Research Articles, Letters and Review</b></h5>
            <h6>Manuscripts are preferred to be presented in the following order:
                <ul>
                    <li>Title</li>
                    <li>Abstract and keywords</li>

                    <li>Figures</li>
                </ul>
            </h6>
            <br>
            <h5><b>3.1 Title</b></h5>
            <h6>Titles do not exceed two lines in print. Titles do not normally include numbers, acronyms, abbreviations or punctuation. They should include sufficient detail for indexing purposes, but be general enough for readers outside the field to appreciate what the paper is about.</h6>
            <br>
            <h5><b>3.2 Abstract</b></h5>
            <h6>We suggest each manuscript should accompany a structured abstract to explain to the general reader why the research was done and why the results are significant. A structured abstract should include such contents: the purpose of the research, the materials and methods and the results. Please do not include citations or undefined abbreviations in the abstract. The preferred length of the abstract is less than 300.</h6>
            <br>
            <h5><b>3.3 Text</b></h5>
            <h6>Research articles are typically 2,000~20,000 words of text (including references, notes and captions, or ~25 printed pages) are expected to present a major advance. <br>
                Research Articles include an abstract, an introduction, up to 2 figures or tables. Materials and Methods should usually be included which will also be needed to support the paper’s conclusions. A typical Letter to IJMMU journal contains about 2,500 words of text (including the first paragraph of Letters, figure legends, reference list and the methods section if applicable) and four small display items (figures and/or tables) with brief legends. Our preferred format is APA and MSWord. We prefer the use of a ‘standard’ font, preferably 12-point Times New Roman.</h6>
            <br>
            <h5><b>3.4 Methods</b></h5>
            <h6>The Methods section should not normally exceed 15,00 words of text, and should be subdivided by short bold headings referring to methods used. If both a Methods Summary and additional Methods section are required, the Methods Summary will appear in print only, but will not appear in the online version of the paper. Therefore, any critical information in the Methods Summary should also be incorporated into the Methods section.</h6>
            <br>
            <h5><b>3.5 End notes</b></h5>
            <h6>End notes are brief and follow the format of Research Articles section. Papers containing supplementary information contain a statement before the reference list: <br>
                Acknowledgements should be brief, and should not include thanks to anonymous referees and editors, inessential words, or effusive comments. Acknowledgements can contain grant and contribution numbers. Author Contributions: authors are required to include a statement to specify the contributions of each co-author. The statement can be up to several sentences long, describing the tasks of individual authors referred to by their initials.</h6>
            <br>
            <h5><b>3.6 References</b></h5>
            <h6>References are each numbered, ordered sequentially as they appear in the text, methods summary, tables, boxes, figure legends, online-only methods in our nature science and engineering journals. Published conference abstracts, numbered patents and preprints on recognized servers may be included in reference lists, but text, grant details and acknowledgements may not. Please follow the style below in the published edition of IJMMU journal in preparing reference lists. <br>
                We advise the authors to use the APA style to write the reference list. You can visit http://www.apastyle.org/ for detail information. There are some examples for APA style.</h6>
